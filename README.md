# WPdata 
Whiteman Park trapping data analysis

This is a package to facilitate analysis of trapping data collected at Whiteman
Park. It is intended for internal use only.

## Quickstart
Install the package from version control from within R:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("carlopacioni/WPdata", build_vignette=TRUE)
```
If you are on Windows and have not used `devtools` before, then you have to 
download the Rtools executable file from CRAN webpage and run it. `devtools` can 
be installed from within R with 
```
install.packages("devtools")
```
Also, if you have problem with the option ```build_vignette=TRUE```, you can just 
use ```install_github("carlopacioni/vortexR")```.
